#Todoer
The name is self-explainatory!
This is my entry project into the world of c++

feel free to donwload and exampine it

#HowTo

<code>
	mkdir -p build
	cd build
	cmake ../
	cmake --build .
	./todoer
</code>

#Features
1- add/read todo objects
2- edit todo objects
3- save todo objects to .csv files
4- load them from .csv files
5- set todos 'home' directory and save files there

#Compilation
The program is compiled on debian gnu/linux (amd64) and utilizes c++11 standard (just to get used 
to c++11 I try to conform to it more often than not)

but given that cmake is at play, you can compile it wherever you want (on windows & mac too)

The program has not achieved version 1.X.X yet! this is because not all main features
are implemented
